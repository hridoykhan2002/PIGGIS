            <h3>Mission & Philosophy </h3>
            <p>At piggies, "Wow" food is not a cliche. Anytime we do not get the "Wow" response from a customer, we consider it a failure. </p>
            <p>Indeed, that's the very reason Ludovic, the owner, launched  Piggies in Barbados, in 2012. He's often heard saying “I’ve always been an enthusiast of food and very intolerant of dishes that were bland and tasteless.” A paying customer has the right to expect food that is enjoyable to the palate. <span>That's our guiding principle. 
                Piggies’s mission is to take the customer on a sensational culinary journey complimented by a very responsive and interactive customer service experience
            </span></p>
            <h3>A bit of Recent history 
            </h3>
            <p>Piggies started humbly in a nicely decorated truck across from Oistins fish market. Soon after, we moved the operation inside the food court at Sheraton mall. The operation has been very successful with, of course, our share of challenges</p>
            <p>One of our success stories is the fact that we have successfully introduced kidney bean rice as a staple in the Bajan daily diet. So much so, that our competitors started offering it as a staple as well. Furthermore, many of our dishes are now Island-wide renowned.  People drive from afar to come to get our delicious pineapple chicken, pigtails rice, kidney rice, ribs, pigtails, and buccaneer chicken</p>
            <p>With the launch of our new delivery and pick-up services, expect a culinary journey that is exciting, consistent, and way above the rest. For that purpose, we have opened up a brand-new kitchen, have revamped our menus, brought in some proven and truly experienced chefs from different Caribbean islands with mastery of old-time cooking.
            </p>
            <p>Let us wow you with our authentic Jerk pork and jerk chicken, the way the masters do it in Jamaica, Money-back guarantee!
                Our must-have old-time pudding and souse (minus the blood), our coucou made just the right way, our superlicious gourmet salads, wraps, sandwiches and the list goes on…. Again, money-back guarantee!
               </p>
